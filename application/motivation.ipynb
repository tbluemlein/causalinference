    "    - Pricing: Estimate how product features (e.g., deductibles, limits, telematics devices) cause changes in claim cost or behavior; introduce discrimination measures to tackle fairness (in insurance pricing)\n",
    "    - Underwriting: Identify which risk factors drive losses, not just correlate\n",
    "    - Claims management: Quantify impact of interventions (e.g., early triage, litigation management, driver training) using causal forests for HTE estimation\n",
    "    - Reserving: Assess causal drivers of development patterns (e.g., policy changes, inflation)\n",
    "    - Customer Management: Predict lapse probability: Test whether retention campaigns cause persistency improvements"
