In the assumption of consistency, we are implicitly making the assumption of no interference; that is, whether one individual receives treatment (or not) has no effect on the potential outcomes of any other individual. This is encapsulated by the usual statistical ‘i.i.d.’ assumption, but it can easily be violated in a study of the effect of a vaccine or if a treatment is assigned at a group level.\n",
