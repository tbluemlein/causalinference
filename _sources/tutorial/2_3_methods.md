# Identification Strategies

The previous sections established *when* a causal effect can be recovered from observational data: the core assumptions ({doc}`2_1_assumptions`) and the graphical criteria for selecting a valid adjustment set ({doc}`2_2_graphical_models`). The central question in observational causal inference is: *which variables should we condition on to identify the causal effect of $T$ on $Y$?* 

This section organises the main **identification strategies** — the structural arguments that re-express a causal estimand purely in terms of the observed data distribution, *before* any particular estimator is chosen. 

Each strategy trades on a different identifying assumption. The choice is dictated by the causal structure encoded in the DAG: which variables are observed, where the confounding enters, and whether a suitable instrument or mediator is available.

## Strategies at a Glance

| Strategy | Identifying assumption | Handles | Estimation (see {doc}`3_inference`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Back-door adjustment** | All confounders of $(T, Y)$ are observed | Measured confounding | {doc}`3_1_propensity`, {doc}`3_2_Regression_Methods` |
| **Front-door adjustment** | An observed mediator intercepts all $T \rightarrow Y$ paths | Unmeasured confounding of $(T, Y)$ | {doc}`3_2_Regression_Methods` |
| **Instrumental variables** | An instrument affects $Y$ only through $T$ | Unmeasured confounding | {doc}`3_2_Regression_Methods` |

## Back-door Adjustment

When the observed covariates $X$ satisfy the {prf:ref}`backdoor-criterion`, the causal effect is identified by the adjustment formula

$$
P(Y \mid \text{do}(T=t)) = \sum_{x} P(Y \mid T=t, X=x)\, P(X=x).
$$

This is the workhorse identification strategy and underpins propensity-score and regression-based estimators in {doc}`3_inference`.

The following criteria provide graphical answers ([Shalizi, 2025, §21.3–21.4](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/ADAfaEPoV/ADAfaEPoV.pdf)).

### The Backdoor Criterion

```{prf:criterion} Backdoor Criterion
:class: dropdown
:label: backdoor-criterion

A set of variables $Z$ satisfies the **backdoor criterion** relative to the ordered pair $(T, Y)$ in a DAG $\mathcal{G}$ if:

1. No node in $Z$ is a **descendant** of $T$, and
2. $Z$ **blocks every path** between $T$ and $Y$ that contains an arrow *into* $T$ (i.e. every "backdoor path").

If $Z$ satisfies the backdoor criterion, then the causal effect of $T$ on $Y$ is identifiable and given by the **adjustment formula**:

$$
P(Y \mid \text{do}(T=t)) = \sum_{z} P(Y \mid T=t, Z=z) \, P(Z=z)
$$
```

The adjustment formula converts the interventional distribution $P(Y \mid \text{do}(T=t))$ into a quantity computable from observational data. This is precisely the bridge between causal and statistical estimands discussed in {prf:ref}`exchangeability` ([Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983](https://doi.org/10.1093/biomet/70.1.41)).

```{prf:algorithm} Backdoor Criterion Check
:label: backdoor-algorithm
:class: dropdown

**Input:** DAG $\mathcal{G}$, treatment $T$, outcome $Y$, candidate adjustment set $Z$

**Output:** `True` if $Z$ satisfies the backdoor criterion, `False` otherwise

1. **Check descendant condition:** For each $z_i \in Z$:
	1. If $z_i \in \text{Descendants}(T)$ in $\mathcal{G}$, return `False`
2. **Enumerate backdoor paths:** Find all paths between $T$ and $Y$ that have an arrow into $T$ (i.e. paths of the form $T \leftarrow \cdots\, Y$ or $T \leftarrow \cdots \rightarrow Y$)
3. **Check blocking:** For each backdoor path $p$:
	1. If $p$ is not blocked by $Z$ (applying the $d$-separation rules from {prf:ref}`blocked-path`), return `False`
4. Return `True`
```

```{prf:example} Applying the Backdoor Criterion
:label: backdoor-example
:class: dropdown

Consider the DAG:

$F \rightarrow T, \quad F \rightarrow Y, \quad T \rightarrow Y$

- **Candidate $Z = \{F\}$**: $F$ is not a descendant of $T$ ✓. The only backdoor path is $T \leftarrow F \rightarrow Y$, which is blocked by conditioning on $F$ ✓. The backdoor criterion is satisfied.
- **Candidate $Z = \emptyset$**: The backdoor path $T \leftarrow F \rightarrow Y$ is not blocked ✗. The criterion fails.
```

## Front-door Adjustment

When confounding between $T$ and $Y$ is unobserved but an observed mediator $M$ intercepts every directed path from $T$ to $Y$, the {prf:ref}`frontdoor-criterion` identifies the effect through a two-stage decomposition that avoids conditioning on the unobserved confounder.

### The Frontdoor Criterion

When all backdoor paths are blocked by **unobserved** confounders, the backdoor criterion cannot be applied. The frontdoor criterion provides an alternative identification strategy through an observed mediator ([Shalizi, 2025, §21.4](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/ADAfaEPoV/ADAfaEPoV.pdf)).

```{prf:criterion} Frontdoor Criterion

:class: dropdown
:label: frontdoor-criterion

A set of variables $M$ satisfies the **frontdoor criterion** relative to $(T, Y)$ in a DAG $\mathcal{G}$ if:

1. $M$ **intercepts all directed paths** from $T$ to $Y$ (i.e. every causal path from $T$ to $Y$ passes through some $m \in M$),
2. There is **no unblocked backdoor path** from $T$ to $M$, and
3. All backdoor paths from $M$ to $Y$ are **blocked by $T$**.

If $M$ satisfies the frontdoor criterion, the causal effect is identified by:

$$
P(Y \mid \text{do}(T=t)) = \sum_{m} P(M=m \mid T=t) \sum_{t'} P(Y \mid T=t', M=m) \, P(T=t')
$$
```

```{prf:algorithm} Frontdoor Criterion Check
:label: frontdoor-algorithm
:class: dropdown

**Input:** DAG $\mathcal{G}$, treatment $T$, outcome $Y$, candidate mediator set $M$

**Output:** `True` if $M$ satisfies the frontdoor criterion, `False` otherwise

1. **Check path interception:** For each directed path $p$ from $T$ to $Y$:
	1. If $p$ does not pass through any $m_i \in M$, return `False`
2. **Check no backdoor $T \to M$:** For each $m_i \in M$:
	1. If there exists an unblocked backdoor path from $T$ to $m_i$ (not through $Y$), return `False`
3. **Check backdoor $M \to Y$ blocked by $T$:** For each $m_i \in M$:
	1. If there exists a backdoor path from $m_i$ to $Y$ that is not blocked by $\{T\}$, return `False`
4. Return `True`
```

```{prf:example} Frontdoor Criterion with Unobserved Confounding
:label: frontdoor-example
:class: dropdown

Consider the DAG where $U$ is unobserved:

$U \rightarrow T, \quad U \rightarrow Y, \quad T \rightarrow M, \quad M \rightarrow Y$

- The backdoor criterion **fails** because we cannot condition on $U$.
- **Candidate $M = \{M\}$**: All causal paths from $T$ to $Y$ go through $M$ ✓. No backdoor path from $T$ to $M$ (since $U \rightarrow T$ and $U \rightarrow Y$, but no path $T \leftarrow \cdots M$ bypassing the direct edge) ✓. The backdoor path from $M$ to $Y$ through $U$ is $M \leftarrow T \leftarrow U \rightarrow Y$, which is blocked by $T$ ✓. The frontdoor criterion is satisfied.
```

### Comparison of Criteria

| | Backdoor Criterion | Frontdoor Criterion |
|---|---|---|
| **Requires** | Observed confounders | Observed mediator |
| **Blocks** | Non-causal (backdoor) paths | Uses causal path through mediator |
| **Fails when** | Confounders are unobserved | No suitable mediator exists |
| **Adjusts for** | Common causes $F$ | Mediator $M$ via two-step identification |


## Causal Discovery

Given observational data, can we *learn* the DAG rather than assuming it? **Causal discovery** algorithms attempt to infer causal structure from conditional independence relations in the data ([Shalizi, 2025, Ch. 22](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/ADAfaEPoV/ADAfaEPoV.pdf)).

### Markov Equivalence

```{prf:definition} Markov Equivalence Class
:label: markov-equivalence
:class: dropdown

Two DAGs are **Markov equivalent** if they encode exactly the same set of $d$-separation (conditional independence) statements. DAGs in the same equivalence class share the same **skeleton** (undirected edges) and the same set of **v-structures** (collider patterns $X \rightarrow C \leftarrow Y$ where $X$ and $Y$ are not adjacent).
```

Observational data alone can only identify the DAG up to its Markov equivalence class. Orienting all edges requires either interventional data or additional assumptions ([Shalizi, 2025, §22.3](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/ADAfaEPoV/ADAfaEPoV.pdf)).

### The SGS Algorithm

The **SGS algorithm** (Spirtes, Glymour & Scheines, 1993) is a constraint-based procedure that recovers the Markov equivalence class from conditional independence tests. The following pseudo-code is adapted from [Shalizi (2025, §22.7)](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/ADAfaEPoV/ADAfaEPoV.pdf).

```{prf:algorithm} SGS Algorithm
:label: sgs-algorithm
:class: dropdown

**Input:** Set of variables $V$, conditional independence oracle (or statistical test)

**Output:** Partially directed graph (CPDAG) representing the Markov equivalence class

**Phase I — Skeleton Recovery:**

1. Start with the **complete undirected graph** on $V$
2. For each pair of nodes $(X, Y)$ with $X \neq Y$:
	1. For each subset $S \subseteq V \setminus \{X, Y\}$ (in order of increasing size):
		1. Test whether $X \perp\!\!\!\perp Y \mid S$
		2. If independent: **remove** the edge $X - Y$ and record $S$ as the **separating set** $\text{Sep}(X,Y) \leftarrow S$
		3. Break (move to next pair)

**Phase II — Orient V-Structures:**

3. For each **unshielded triple** $(X, Z, Y)$ — where $X - Z$ and $Z - Y$ but $X$ and $Y$ are **not** adjacent:
	1. If $Z \notin \text{Sep}(X, Y)$: orient as $X \rightarrow Z \leftarrow Y$ (v-structure / collider)

**Phase III — Orient Remaining Edges:**

4. Repeatedly apply the following **orientation rules** until no more edges can be oriented:
	1. **Acyclicity:** If $X \rightarrow Z - Y$ and $X$ and $Y$ are not adjacent, orient as $Z \rightarrow Y$
	2. **No new v-structures:** If there is a directed path $X \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow Y$ and an undirected edge $X - Y$, orient as $X \rightarrow Y$
```

The SGS algorithm is correct under the assumptions of the Causal Markov Condition ({prf:ref}`causal-markov`) and faithfulness ({prf:ref}`faithfulness`). In practice, the **PC algorithm** (a computationally efficient variant) is more commonly used: it restricts the conditioning sets in Phase I to neighbours of $X$ or $Y$ in the current skeleton, greatly reducing the number of tests ([Shalizi, 2025, §22.4](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/ADAfaEPoV/ADAfaEPoV.pdf)).

```{prf:remark}
:label: discovery-limitations
:class: dropdown

Causal discovery from observational data has fundamental limitations:
- It can only recover the **Markov equivalence class**, not the unique DAG.
- It requires **faithfulness**, which can be violated when causal effects cancel.
- It assumes **no latent confounders** (for the basic SGS/PC algorithms; extensions like FCI handle latent variables).
- Statistical tests for conditional independence have limited power in finite samples, especially with many conditioning variables.
```

## Instrumental Variables

When no admissible adjustment set exists, an **instrument** $Z$ — a source of exogenous variation in $T$ that affects $Y$ only through $T$ — can identify a local causal effect. The instrumental-variable estimator and its two-stage least-squares implementation are developed in {doc}`3_2_Regression_Methods`.

```{note}
:class: dropdown
This section frames identification only. *How* to estimate each identified quantity from a finite sample — with propensity scores, regression, machine-learning, tree-based, or Bayesian methods — is the subject of {doc}`3_inference`, and the robustness of the underlying assumptions is examined in {doc}`4_sensitivity`.
