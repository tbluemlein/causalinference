    "However, we can only **observe one** of these outcomes — the one corresponding to the actual treatment received. This is known as the **fundamental problem of causal inference**: We never observe both potential outcomes for the same unit. \n",
    "\n",
    "Only one of the outcomes is observed for each unit: either the outcome if treated $Y(T = 1)$ or the outcome if untreated $Y(T = 0)$. Individual causal effects cannot be expressed as a function of the observed data because of missing data. Identifying individual causal effects is generally impossible. Nonetheless, we aim to identify the average causal effect in a population of interest."
